<h2 id="study-planning"><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap me-3"></i>Study in Europe Planning</h2>
Find the right master’s program and university in Europe.

Europe offers incredible opportunities for biomedical students—but choosing the right country, university, and program can be overwhelming. I’ve been through that exact process, and I know how confusing it can be.

During my preparation in 2021, I received admissions from several prestigious programs, including:
*   FAU Erlangen (Germany)
*   Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)
*   VUB Brussels

Each option had its strengths, and through continuous research and conversations with experts in various fields, I was able to make an informed decision. I ultimately chose the Bionics Engineering program in Italy, which aligned perfectly with my interests in Medical Robotics Engineering.

In 2024, I graduated with the “UNIPI cum laude merit award”, a distinction awarded for an outstanding final grade at the University of Pisa.
Now, I help you navigate this same journey—shortlisting universities, understanding program structures, and aligning your choices with your career goals.

<h2 id="scholarship-support"><i class="fas fa-award me-3"></i>Scholarship Application Support</h2>
Funding your future, without the financial strain.

When I chose to study abroad, I didn’t want to place a financial burden on my parents. I completed my master’s in Italy with a fully funded merit scholarship—covering nearly €30,000 and exempting me from tuition fees. Many universities across Europe offer scholarships, and while it’s competitive, with genuine motivation and hard work, it could also achieved. I’ll guide you through the entire process—from identifying opportunities to crafting strong applications.

<h2 id="application-documents"><i class="fas fa-file-alt me-3"></i>CV, Cover Letter & ATS-Friendly Applications</h2>
When I first started applying to universities and jobs, I struggled to craft a CV and cover letter that truly reflected my strengths. Despite the rise of AI tools, I learned that nothing replaces well-thought-out content tailored to your profile and goals. Over time, I understood how to format documents to meet European standards and pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)—especially in STEM fields. Whether you want to build your application yourself or need help getting it ready, I’ll support you every step of the way.

<h2 id="internship-support"><i class="fas fa-magnifying-glass me-3"></i>Internship & Job Application Support</h2>
Real experience builds real growth.

I’ve always believed that hands-on experience is the best way to discover and develop your potential. As a student, I actively pursued internships—starting at the Biosensors Research Lab at IIT Madras, and later completing my master’s thesis at the Carl Zeiss Innovation Hub in Karlsruhe. Each opportunity shaped my professional and personal growth.

Today, I work as a Medical Robotics System Test Engineer at B. Braun New Ventures in Freiburg, continuing to learn and evolve. I know how challenging it can be to find the right opportunity at the right time—and I’m here to help you navigate that journey. From identifying biomedical internships and jobs in Europe to preparing strong applications and interview strategies, I’ll support you every step of the way.

<h2 id="visa-assistance"><i class="fas fa-passport me-3"></i>Visa Application Assistance</h2>
Guidance from someone who’s done it independently.

I applied for both my Italian student visa and later my German work visa entirely on my own, without any agency support. I understand how confusing the process can be—figuring out requirements, gathering documents, and booking appointments. While I don’t guarantee outcomes or take responsibility for applications, I can support you by clarifying the process, answering your questions, and helping you prepare the right documents with confidence.
